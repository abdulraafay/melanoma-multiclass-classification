# Melanoma Multiclass Classification
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Melanoma multiclass classification problem - We are training a custom model to predict 9 different skin issue, one of which is cancer
- Melanoma, a skin cancer, is one of the classes we are trying to accurately predict
- To give physicians an accurate prediction of melanoma cases using AI, so they can carefully go about such cases
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- After various trainings for 30 epochs, I conclude that we will need transfer learning approach to fit the model better to the small dataset

## Technologies Used
- tensorflow 
- keras 
- numpy
- matplotlib
